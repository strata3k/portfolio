    <h2>The Project Overview</h2>
    <section class="writingText">
        <p>Writing was one of the most key parts of my time in High School. This writing was for my English class at CART. In the essay, it was needed to be 1000 words and needed to include the text for reference. The text was from `Ready Player One` and was about explaining how friendship plays a key part in the story.  </p>

        <p>I had to make a developer log for my recent projects dating back from February twenty fourth. It includes all of my thoughts during the making of those projects, what happened during the day, and how I felt overall. The log acutally helps me mentally because it allows me to get things off my mind. </p>
