    <h2>The Project Overview</h2>
    <section class="cshiftText">
        <p>Another project I made was a website dedicated towards a fictional story for a safari expedition. I worked on this by myself and made a wireframe, used Adobe Photoshop for certain images, and coded using Visual Code Studio. Learning Adobe Photoshop was a little challenging, but I was able to work efficiently using it in the end. Persistence using Adobe Photoshop allowed me to create the website`s images and logo</p>
        <p>I`ve already used Figma and Visual Code Studio, but not Adobe Photoshop, at this time. So, learning it was a little challenging, but it was rewarding because it`s really useful for all things dedicated towards design. There were still errors because I was just learning how to use Adobe Photoshop, but in the end I was able to fix it before presenting my website to my classmates. Another thing I learned was using media queries in Visual Code Studio. I was able to configure the website for tablet and desktop, but didn`t have enough time to configure it for phones. But, I did learn how to use media queries and, so with that knowledge I can configure other websites as well.</p>
        <p>Some challenges of learning while doing a project is time management. I had to learn photoshop and then proceed on editing my image before I was able to import it into the Visual Code Studio. I had a lot of photos on my website, so it took some time to edit all of those images. Also learning media queries at first was tricky because of time as well. When learning media queries it was near the end of the project and, so I had to go back to my project and input that in. </p>
        <p>Throughout this project I persisted in learning new information and new techniques. Whether that be learning media queries or photoshop, I learned the basics of it during this project. Also had to deal with nights where I had less sleep in order to put in the images in my website and position them accordingly. This project helped me manage my time and also learn more skills that will help me along the way in my career. </p>
