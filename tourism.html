    <h2>The Project Overview</h2>

    <section class="tourText">
        <p>A collaborative assignment that I worked on was making a travel website. I was in a group of four and had our own countries that we picked. We researched our individual website and then worked together on the design of the website and to code it. This project was for an “open house” in which we showcased our project to guests. This assignment overall was a great experience because this was the first time for groups to work together on coding.</p>
        <p>During this project we used Adobe Photoshop, Canva, Figma, GitHub, and Visual Code Studio. Using Photoshop for this project was to scale our images for our website. It was a great tool to use and was easy to learn. Canva was also used to scale some of our images, usually our smaller images. Figma was used to outline our website and how each page was going to look. We used GitHub as our cloud service, pushing and pulling updates from one another. Lastly, we put it all together in Visual Code Studio using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript. </p>
        <p>Since this was the first time working together on a larger project, there were some collaboration issues. Sometimes, we had different insights on certain parts of the website. Other times, we might`ve had someone off task so we had to reel them back into the work. I did enjoy working with this team, it was really enjoyable when we worked together to all solve one problem. It also helped creating things because we were all different, so a lot of ideas were able to come together at the end of the project. </p>
        <p>My team collaborated with each other about this project. It was challenging at some points, but was very satisfying at the end of the project. While working together we communicated what we wanted and what we didn`t want. Those who disagreed were able to compromise for a solution. In the end, we were finally able to see all of our work put together and working beautifully. </p>
