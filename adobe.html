    <h2>The Project Overview</h2>
    <section class="adobeText">
        <p>The first website that I made was the “About Me” page on Adobe Express. On this website it was the first big project at CART. For the project, a business card was needed and a written short biography. There was also a rubric that was needed for the biography including what we liked, what we wanted to do in life, what we see ourselves doing in four years, and a little bit of ourselves.</p>
        <p>This was my first time working while using Adobe Express. But, I was able to learn it very quickly and was able to put everything needed on there. I added photos of myself and things relating towards what the rubric needed. I also helped other students who ran into issues such as their google account being unable to sync with Adobe Express. I made my business card on Canva and made it in theme with my presentation.</p>
        <p>The challenges I faced were trying to find what to talk about. In reality, I was thinking a little too hard about the prompt and took a little bit too much time. Whether it would be what I see myself doing in four years or what I wanted to do in life took a little too long. In the end, I finished the website with information that I felt like would be a possibility, but not set in stone. </p>
        <p>I collaborated with my fellow classmates on the website as well. Giving them ideas and in return they would give me their feedback. I did the same with them, giving them feedback on their website. I connected their feedback to my website and changed it accordingly, making sure everything was flowing correctly and trimming excess dialogue. </p>
