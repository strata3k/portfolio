    <h2>The Project Overview</h2>

    <section class="istoryText">
    <p>The most recent project that I worked on was making an interactive story. This was apart of my final at the Center of Advanced Research and Technology (CART). This was the most fun I had making a project. I had to use LucidChart, Visual Code Studio, Google Documents, and Google slides. During this, it was very time consuming going through each process. But, I perservered throughout and created my final product.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was little, I wanted to be a game developer. This project allowed me to have a to have all creative control on it. And with that, it made me thrive and make a parody of my favorite video game. I also presented a powerpoint of my interactive story as well. Either way, I enjoyed this project the most.</p>
    <p>Like most projects, you would need a roadmap. Completing the roadmap for me during this was kinda difficult because it was a lot to work on. Whether it was making the LucidChart and or writing all the dialogue on a Google Document, it was time consuming. But, that was really just it, just time consuming nothing too hard really. </p>
    <p>As the clock kept on dwindiling down for the project I had to perservere. Even though I felt like I was "done" it felt like I wasn`t so I continued and continued to work on it. Whether it was passion and or perfectionism, I was a little too close to the due date to be spending time on that. But, I still did and I managed to finish the project as well before the due date.  </p>
